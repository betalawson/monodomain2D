% This matrix takes an input stiffness and mass matrix as well as the 
% desired timestep (assumed fixed) and creates instead a problem expressed 
% as:
%
%     A_new * V_new = A_old * V_old - A_J * J
%
% that represents the diffusive updates to the system as calculated by
% replacement of the time derivative with a Crank-Nicholson timestepping
% scheme. No similar operation is required for the reaction terms because 
% the mass matrix applies equally to the time derivative and the reaction 
% update. This code is used simply to avoid re-calculation of unchanging 
% matrices.

% Apply the requested amount of mass-lumping to create a new modified mass
% matrix
